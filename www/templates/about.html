                    Since the mid-sixties, the Institute of Chartered Accountants (Ghana) has been providing accountancy training at both technician and professional levels. However, in those early days, pass rates at various levels were impeded by the non-availability of
                    reading materials for students. This trend experienced a turn around, in the 80s and has seen a major boost since accounting manuals for the four (levels) were introduced in November 2008.

                    The establishment of the ICAG School in June 2009 augmented the Institute’s effort to provide readily available tuition to prospective and regular students on part-time and regular streams.

                    This tie in with the Institute’s bid to provide quality tuition at the three levels (that is, Parts 1-3) in a conducive learning environment at the ICAG School located at Okponglo, East Legon, along the Trinity Theological Seminary-IPS Road.
